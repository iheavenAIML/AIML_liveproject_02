**Scope of the project**: A used cars dealership has approached us and asked us to help them to answer the question of which factors affect the price of the car the most. Our deliverable was determined to be an executive summary detailing our findings. 

Executive Summary:

Dear Management,

We are pleased to present the findings of our analysis regarding the influential factors on used car prices, based on the dataset provided by your dealership. Our analysis aimed to identify key determinants affecting the price of pre-owned vehicles in your inventory. We found it to be amount of cylinders, paint color, car's body type, and odometer reading.
Please find here an in-depth data analysis and AI modeling with the code base in the following file 

Key Steps Performed During Analysis:
1. Meticulous Data Analysis: The provided dataset was meticulously examined to understand its structure, features, and distributions. This involved exploring variables such as amount of cylinders, paint color, car's body type, and odometer reading, among others.
2. Data Pre-processing and Cleaning: To ensure the reliability and accuracy of our analysis, we pre-processed and cleaned the data. This involved removing missing or unusable data points, ensuring a high-quality dataset for further analysis.
3. Machine Learning Models: Utilizing advanced AI models, specifically Linear Regression and Ridge Regression, we applied the pre-processed data to predict the prices of used cars. These models were chosen for their effectiveness in handling regression tasks and their ability to capture complex relationships within the data.
4. Evaluation of Results: The predictions generated by the machine learning models were carefully evaluated against the actual prices of the used cars. This step allowed us to assess the performance of the models and the accuracy of their predictions.
5. Identification of Influential Factors: Through our analysis, we identified several factors significantly impacting the price of used cars. Among these factors, the amount of cylinders, paint color, car body type, and odometer reading emerged as the most influential determinants of car prices.

In conclusion, our analysis indicates that the number of cylinders, paint color, car's body type, and odometer reading are pivotal factors influencing the prices of used cars in your inventory. By leveraging these insights, your dealership can make informed decisions regarding pricing strategies, inventory management, and customer engagement, ultimately enhancing profitability and customer satisfaction.
